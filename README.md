# M1-End-of-year-Project
Project on the chaotic behaviour of measles epidemic periodicity using a TSIR model in R. Implemented the model from scratch, estimated parameters for multiple cities in the UK and US and also made predictions on the number of cases. 

The goal of the project was to implement the model and reproduce the results from the research article of Benjamin D.Dalziel: "Persistent Chaos of Measles Epidemics in the Prevaccination United States Caused by a Small Change in Seasonal Transmission Patterns"
Content:
